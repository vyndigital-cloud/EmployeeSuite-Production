## 🎯 WHAT WAS FIXED

### 1. **Shopify Connection** ✅
**Before:**
- "You'll need your store URL and Admin API access token from Shopify"

**After:**
- "You can connect manually by entering your store URL and Admin API access token, or use the OAuth flow if installing from the Shopify App Store."

**Why:** App supports BOTH manual connection AND OAuth. FAQ should mention both options.

---

### 2. **Cancel Subscription** ✅
**Before:**
- "Go to Settings → Manage Subscription → Cancel. No questions asked."

**After:**
- "Go to Settings → Subscription → Cancel Subscription. You'll retain access until the end of your current billing period. No questions asked."

**Why:** 
- More accurate path (Settings → Subscription, not "Manage Subscription")
- Important to mention you keep access until billing period ends (this is what the code does)

---

### 3. **Payment Failure** ✅
**Before:**
- "Your account stays active for 3 days while we retry the payment. After 3 days, access is suspended until payment succeeds."

**After:**
- "You'll receive an email notification. Your account will be suspended if payment isn't received within 3 days. Update your payment method to restore access."

**Why:** More accurate - clarifies that suspension happens if payment isn't received, and how to fix it.

---

### 4. **Refunds** ✅
**Before:**
- "Yes. If you're not satisfied within the first 7 days, email us for a full refund."

**After:**
- "Refund requests are handled on a case-by-case basis. Email us at adam@golproductions.com within 7 days of purchase to request a refund. We'll review your request and respond within 24 hours."

**Why:** 
- More honest - no automatic refunds (there's no refund code in the app)
- Case-by-case is more accurate
- Provides clear process (email, 7 days, 24hr response)
