### Step 3: Increase the Limit
1. Click **"Edit"** or **"Change"** next to Build Spend Limit
2. Set it to:
   - **$10/month** (minimum for Starter plan)
   - OR **$20/month** (safer, gives buffer)

### Option A: Check Billing Tab

3. They'll do it instantly

### Option C: Add Payment Method First
Sometimes you need a payment method before increasing limits:

3. Then try increasing the build spend limit
4. Then upgrade to Starter plan

## 💰 What Build Spend Limit Means

- **Free tier:** Usually $0 build spend limit (or very low)
- **Starter plan:** Needs at least $7/month build spend limit
- **The limit:** Maximum you're willing to spend on builds per month

**Setting it to $10-20/month is safe** - you'll only pay for what you use (Starter is $7/month).
