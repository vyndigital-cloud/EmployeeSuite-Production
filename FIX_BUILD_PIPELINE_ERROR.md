## 💰 What You Get

**Before (Free):**
- ❌ 500 build minutes/month (you used them all)
- ❌ App spins down after 15 min
- ❌ Cold starts (15-30 second delays)

**After (Starter $7/month):**
- ✅ 1,000 build minutes/month
- ✅ Always-on (no spin-down)
- ✅ No cold starts
- ✅ Better for production

---

## ⚡ Alternative: Wait Until Next Month

If you don't want to pay $7:
- **Wait until the 1st of next month**
- Build minutes reset automatically
- Then deploy

**But:** Your app will still spin down and have cold starts (bad for Shopify apps).

---

## 🎯 Recommendation

**Upgrade to Starter ($7/month)** because:
1. **Shopify apps need to be always-on** - Users expect instant access
2. **Cold starts hurt UX** - 15-30 second delays = bad reviews
3. **$7/month is cheap** - Less than a coffee
4. **You can cancel anytime** - No commitment

## 📍 Where to Find "Plan" in Render Dashboard

If you can't find it:
1. **Render Dashboard** → Your service
2. Look for:
   - **Left sidebar:** "Plan" or "Instance Type"
   - **Top menu:** "Settings" → "Plan"
   - **Service overview:** "Free" badge → click to upgrade

---

## ✅ After Upgrade

- ✅ Build pipeline error disappears
- ✅ You can deploy immediately
- ✅ App stays online 24/7
- ✅ No more cold starts

---

**TL;DR: Render Dashboard → Your Service → Change Plan → Select Starter ($7/month) → Deploy! 🚀**
