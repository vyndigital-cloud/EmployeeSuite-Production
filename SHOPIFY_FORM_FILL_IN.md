### 3. Install Requirements

#### Sales channel requirements

**Current state:** Both radio buttons appear selected (UI glitch)

**Action:**
1. **Select:** "My app requires" (first radio button)
2. **Check:** ✅ "Shopify Online Store" checkbox
3. **Leave unchecked:** "Shopify POS" checkbox

**Why:** Your app is a web-based dashboard that connects to Shopify stores via API. It requires the Online Store sales channel to access order, inventory, and product data.

**Do NOT select:** "My app doesn't require the Shopify Online Store or Shopify POS"
