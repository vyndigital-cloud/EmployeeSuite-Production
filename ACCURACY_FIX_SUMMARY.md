# ✅ ACCURACY FIX COMPLETE - 100% HONEST DESCRIPTIONS

**Date:** December 8, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **ALL MISLEADING CLAIMS FIXED**

---

## 🎯 WHAT WAS FIXED

### 1. **"Automated Order Processing"** → **"Order Monitoring"**
- **Before:** "Automatically process orders"
- **After:** "View pending and unfulfilled orders"
- **Why:** App shows orders, doesn't actually process them automatically

### 2. **"Profit Calculations"** → **"Revenue Analytics"**
- **Before:** "Profit calculations by product"
- **After:** "Revenue breakdown by product"
- **Why:** App only shows revenue, no cost data = no profit calculation

### 3. **"Customizable Thresholds"** → **"10 Unit Threshold"**
- **Before:** "Low-stock alerts with customizable thresholds"
- **After:** "Low-stock alerts (10 unit threshold)"
- **Why:** Threshold is hardcoded to 10, not customizable

### 4. **"99.9% Uptime Guarantee"** → **"High Availability"**
- **Before:** "99.9% uptime guarantee"
- **After:** "High availability infrastructure"
- **Why:** Can't guarantee uptime without SLA

### 5. **"Real-Time"** → **"Frequently Updated"**
- **Before:** "Real-time order status synchronization"
- **After:** "Updated frequently (30-60 second refresh)"
- **Why:** Data is cached, not truly real-time

### 6. **"Batch Processing"** → **REMOVED**
- **Before:** "Batch processing capabilities"
- **After:** Removed entirely
- **Why:** Not accurate - just fetches all orders

### 7. **"Process Orders" Button** → **"View Orders"**
- **Before:** "Process Orders Now"
- **After:** "View Orders"
- **Why:** More accurate - shows orders, doesn't process them
